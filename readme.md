## A simple train schedule app

This app keeps tracks of train schedules submitted to firebase and returned. It does some simple calculations and posts the results to a train board.

There is a firebase integration that updates trains on firebase and displays them back out to the user.

The site is also connected to momentjs for time based calcs.
